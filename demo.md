# What is it?
> A password Store which Perfectly Hides from Itself (No eXaggeration)

too good to be true?

Notes:
- SPHINX stands for "a password Store which Perfectly Hides from Itself (No eXaggeration)". 
- It is a novel implementation of a password store which remains secure even when the password manager itself has been compromised. Sounds too good to be true?

# How does it work?
Elliptic Curves

![elliptic curve addition](/ellipticcurveaddition.gif)

----

# Math
\\( p = (a,b) \in G_{\text{elliptic curve}} \\)

\\( p + p  \in G_{\text{elliptic curve}} \\)

\\( p^n = \underbrace{p + ... + p}_{\text{n times}} \\)
